# OOP Coffee Machine

This is my coding challenge submission for day #16 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This is application is essentially identical to my day 15 submission. https://github.com/KalBartal/Coffee-Machine

They key difference is that this version utilises Object Oriented Programming.

The application replicates the operation of a real coffee machine. It asks for the user's choice of drink, then it asks for and processes coins. Different drinks are made from different recipes and the application manages their resources which it displays on request by the "report" command.

The application provides a user-friendly command line interface with error-handling and looping to achieve a smooth user experience. The application also supports command line input through both keyboard and mouse.
